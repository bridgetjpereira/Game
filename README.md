# Game

Creating a game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Opted for simple matching game, as I am a novice!

Concept: Two linked webpages. 

Webpage 1 shows image of the doorway to a haunted stately home. Click on the letterbox to enter the game. (Ideally, the sound effect of a creaking old door should be initialised when you click to enter!)

Webpage 2 shows a portrait gallery inside the stately home. Portraits of family are set in frames and hidden behind black squares. Click on the squares inside the frames to reveal the portraits. Score points for matching the most portraits in the quickest amount of time. 

Aim of game: is to matched all of the portraits in under 2 mins. 

If successful: Alert
